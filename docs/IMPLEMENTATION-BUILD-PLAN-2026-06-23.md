# Lumen Light Implementation Build Plan

Prepared: 2026-06-23

Purpose: turn the current product framing into codeable, testable steps. This
is not a philosophy document. It is the build plan for getting Lumen Light into
a local testable state.

For the overnight implementation spec with concrete data shapes, UI behavior,
acceptance criteria, and out-of-scope boundaries, use
`docs/OVERNIGHT-BRIEFING-REVIEW-BUILD-SPEC-2026-06-23.md`.

## Build Target

Build a local agent-led briefing surface where one user can load source
material, see an agent briefing about that material, watch the referenced
source spans highlight, review proposed whiteboard/review artifacts, and export
the accepted results.

The user-facing experience is:

```text
source document/transcript
  + agent chat/briefing
  + synchronized highlights
  + staged review cards
  + integrated Excalidraw projection
  -> accepted export packet
```

Provenance is an enabling trust layer. It should be implemented in the data
model, but it is not the headline user experience.

## Current Starting Point

Useful code already exists:

- `src/static-highlighter/lumen-light.js` highlights static HTML source text.
- `examples/static-highlight-demo.html` demonstrates local highlighting.
- `schemas/conversation-artifact.schema.json` validates single artifacts.
- `scripts/validate_artifact.py` validates public JSON fixtures.
- `prototypes/lumen-light-whiteboard-prototype/` has an Excalidraw-based
  transcript-to-whiteboard prototype with tests.

Main gap:

- there is no single local app that combines source pane, agent briefing pane,
  synchronized highlight activation, staged artifacts, Excalidraw projection,
  accept/reject/edit, and export.

## Sprint 1: Local Briefing Review Page With Excalidraw Projection

Goal: create the smallest testable product loop without voice.

Build:

1. Add a Lumen-owned review page under `examples/briefing-review-demo.html` or
   a small `src/briefing-review/` module.
2. Render one synthetic source document/transcript.
3. Render an agent briefing pane with scripted turns.
4. Each scripted agent turn includes:
   - text the agent says
   - one source-span reference
   - one proposed artifact
5. Clicking or playing a briefing turn activates the matching highlight in the
   source pane.
6. Proposed artifacts appear in a staging/review area.
7. Proposed artifacts also project into an Excalidraw lane as cards or nodes.
8. User can accept, reject, or edit each proposed artifact.
9. Excalidraw projection updates when the artifact state or text changes.
10. Accepted artifacts export as JSON.

Acceptance tests:

- opening the demo shows source, briefing, and staging panes
- activating a briefing turn highlights the expected source span
- activating a briefing turn creates or focuses the expected Excalidraw
  projection object
- accepting an artifact changes its state to accepted
- accepting an artifact updates the projection state
- rejecting an artifact changes its state to rejected
- rejecting an artifact removes or visibly marks the projection
- exported JSON includes only accepted artifacts unless a debug option includes
  rejected artifacts
- existing artifact validation still passes

Files likely touched:

- `examples/briefing-review-demo.html`
- `src/static-highlighter/lumen-light.js`
- new `src/briefing-review/*.js`
- new `examples/briefing-session.example.json`
- `test/` for schema/export validation
- projection mapping tests for Excalidraw element generation

## Sprint 2: Artifact Contract That Supports The Demo

Goal: make the data contract match the product loop.

Build:

1. Add artifact kinds used by the product:
   - `claim`
   - `decision`
   - `question`
   - `risk`
   - `action`
   - `insight`
   - `highlight`
2. Add approval state:
   - `staged`
   - `accepted`
   - `rejected`
   - `edited`
3. Add origin/provenance fields that distinguish:
   - source text
   - agent interpretation
   - human approval/edit
4. Allow document-first artifacts that have `source_span` but no
   `source_turn_ids`.
5. Add packet-level export schema.

Acceptance tests:

- each artifact kind has a valid fixture
- staged, accepted, rejected, and edited examples validate
- document-first artifact validates with `source_span`
- packet fixture validates
- invalid packets fail deterministically

Files likely touched:

- `schemas/conversation-artifact.schema.json`
- new `schemas/export-packet.schema.json`
- `examples/*.example.json`
- `scripts/validate_artifact.py`
- `test/test_validate_artifact.py`

## Sprint 3: Agent-Briefing Adapter

Goal: replace scripted briefing turns with an agent adapter while keeping the
same UI contract.

Build:

1. Define a local `briefing_turn` shape:
   - `turn_id`
   - `speaker`
   - `text`
   - `source_span_refs`
   - `proposed_artifact_ids`
2. Add a deterministic fixture-backed adapter first.
3. Add a model-backed adapter second.
4. Ensure model output can only create staged artifacts.
5. Keep human approval as the only path to accepted artifacts.

Acceptance tests:

- fixture adapter produces repeatable briefing turns
- model adapter output is parsed into the same shape
- malformed model output is rejected
- model-created artifacts are always staged

Files likely touched:

- new `src/briefing-review/briefing-turns.js`
- new `src/briefing-review/agent-adapter.js`
- new fixtures under `examples/`
- tests for adapter parsing and failure cases

## Sprint 4: Productize Excalidraw Integration

Goal: deepen the Excalidraw projection without changing the core rule that
Lumen artifact/review state owns durability.

Build:

1. Replace the minimal first-slice projection with a richer Excalidraw renderer.
2. Support artifact grouping, connectors, and viewport focus.
3. Keep artifact JSON as the durable state.
4. Treat Excalidraw element JSON as view/projection state only.

Acceptance tests:

- artifact cards map to deterministic Excalidraw elements
- rejected artifacts are not projected by default or are visibly marked
- changing projection does not mutate accepted artifact content
- viewport focus follows the active briefing turn

Files likely touched:

- `prototypes/lumen-light-whiteboard-prototype/src/whiteboard-elements.js`
- bridge module between `src/briefing-review/` and prototype code
- prototype tests

## Sprint 5: OpenAI Realtime Voice Briefer

Goal: add voice after the text briefing loop is testable.

Build:

1. Add trusted endpoint to mint ephemeral Realtime session credentials.
2. Add browser WebRTC client for `gpt-realtime-2`.
3. Define Realtime tools:
   - `highlight_source_span`
   - `create_staged_artifact`
   - `focus_artifact`
   - `request_human_review`
4. Tool calls write staged artifacts or active highlights only.
5. Spoken turns are captured as briefing turns.
6. Barge-in/interruption keeps UI state consistent.

Acceptance tests:

- browser never receives a long-lived API key
- Realtime tool call creates staged artifact, not accepted artifact
- interruption does not auto-accept anything
- text fallback still works when voice is unavailable

Files likely touched:

- prototype server or new app server endpoint
- browser WebRTC client module
- briefing-turn adapter
- tests/mocks for tool calls

## Immediate First PR

The first PR should not touch voice, schema reconciliation, or model-backed
generation. It should include Excalidraw as the visual projection lane from the
beginning.

Implement:

1. `examples/briefing-session.example.json`
2. `examples/briefing-review-demo.html`
3. a tiny review UI that:
   - renders source text
   - renders scripted agent turns
   - highlights the referenced source span
   - shows staged artifacts
   - projects staged/accepted artifacts into Excalidraw
   - accepts/rejects artifacts
   - exports accepted JSON
4. tests for artifact state transitions, projection mapping, and export shape

Definition of done:

- a local browser demo proves the core product interaction
- the demo includes Excalidraw as a visible integrated projection surface
- the demo can be shown without explaining architecture first
- the user can test the loop in under five minutes

## Opus Review Guardrail

Any future Opus review should answer implementation questions only:

- What code should change first?
- What is the first PR?
- What test proves it works?
- What should be explicitly deferred?
- What existing file contradicts the next build step?

Do not ask Opus to re-evaluate the moat, the philosophy, or whether
provenance matters. Treat source linkage as an implementation requirement and
keep the review focused on building a testable product.
