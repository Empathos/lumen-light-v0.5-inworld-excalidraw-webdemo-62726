# Spec: Lumen-Light

The shared source of truth for what we're building, how to run it, and how the
runtime contract behaves. Product rationale lives in [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md);
structure in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md); decisions in
[`decisions/`](decisions/).

> "Beacon Table" is a legacy name kept only cosmetically in the PRD for
> historical reasons. The project name is **Lumen Light**.

## Objective

A voice-and-text thinking canvas: the user thinks out loud (or types), and an AI
collaborator draws on a shared Excalidraw whiteboard in real time — diagrams,
sticky notes, shapes, connectors, generated images, web-page screenshots — and
can brief the user through a document. Success = the agent visualizes ideas live,
the user stays in control of the canvas, and input modality (voice/text) makes no
difference to behavior.

## Tech Stack

- React 18, TypeScript 5, Vite 5
- Excalidraw 0.18 (canvas), dark theme by default
- Inworld Realtime API over WebRTC (voice + text + tools); LLM via an Inworld
  router, voice via `inworld-tts-2` + `inworld-stt-1` + `semantic_vad`
- Google Gemini ("Nano Banana") for `generate_image`; Tavily/Brave for
  `web_search`; thum.io for `screenshot_website`
- Server logic in `server/backend.ts`, exposed locally by a Vite dev middleware
  and in production by Netlify Functions (no other backend)
- localStorage scene persistence; installable PWA (manifest + service worker)

## Commands

```text
Install: npm install
Dev:     npm run dev        # http://localhost:5180
Build:   npm run build      # tsc -b && vite build
Preview: npm run preview
Types:   npm run typecheck  # tsc -b --noEmit
```

Environment (`.env.local`, gitignored). The Inworld key is required for the live
session; each optional key unlocks one tool (omit to disable it):

```text
INWORLD_API_KEY=your-inworld-api-key
INWORLD_REALTIME_MODEL=inworld/lumen-router   # router id (see scripts/create-inworld-router.sh)
INWORLD_REALTIME_VOICE=Sarah
# optional: INWORLD_STT_MODEL=inworld/inworld-stt-1, INWORLD_TTS_MODEL=inworld-tts-2
GEMINI_API_KEY=...        # generate_image
TAVILY_API_KEY=...        # web_search (preferred); or BRAVE_API_KEY (fallback)
THUM_IO_KEY=...           # screenshot_website
```

## Code Style

TypeScript, strict mode, function components, no default exports for modules.
Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Conventions: validate untrusted input before
it touches the canvas; mirror Excalidraw values from the installed package rather
than guessing.

## Runtime Contract (tools)

The agent drives the canvas exclusively through these tools. The two **draw**
tools replace what the previous draw call produced; images, screenshots, and the
document window are not erased by a redraw.

### `draw_canvas` (primary)

`{ title?, elements: Element[] }` where each `Element` is:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id` | string | unique; referenced by connectors |
| `type` | `shape` \| `text` \| `note` \| `connector` | |
| `geo` | enum | for `shape`: `rectangle, ellipse, diamond` (Excalidraw's only closed shapes; anything else falls back to `rectangle`) |
| `text` | string | label / note / connector label |
| `x,y,w,h` | number | optional; missing x/y auto-grids |
| `color` | enum | `black, grey, light-violet, violet, blue, light-blue, yellow, orange, green, light-green, light-red, red, white` |
| `fill` | enum | `none, semi, solid, pattern, fill` |
| `size` | enum | `s, m, l, xl` |
| `from,to` | string | for `connector`: source/target element ids |

### `draw_flow` (shortcut)

`{ title?, nodes: {id,label,kind}[], edges: {from,to,label?}[] }`,
`kind ∈ {start, process, decision, end}`. Maps start/end→ellipse,
decision→diamond, process→rectangle, joined by bound arrows.

### `capture_canvas` (vision feedback)

No args. Screenshots the canvas (Excalidraw `exportToBlob`, forced light theme
for legibility, PNG) and returns it to the model as an `input_image` so it can
verify layout and call a draw tool again to realign. See
[ADR-0005](decisions/ADR-0005-screenshot-feedback-loop.md).

### `generate_image`

`{ prompt, aspect?, x?, y? }`. Generates an image via Google Gemini ("Nano
Banana") server-side and places it on the canvas. Persists across draws.

### `screenshot_website`

`{ url, x?, y? }`. Captures a live public web page via thum.io server-side and
places it on the canvas as an image. Bare domains are normalized to `https://`.
Persists across draws.

### `web_search`

`{ query }`. Searches the live web (Tavily preferred, Brave fallback) and returns
a synthesized answer plus source results (`title, url, snippet`).

### Document briefing tools

- `open_document` — `{ markdown, title? }`. Opens a Markdown document in a window
  on the canvas; returns a section outline (each with an id).
- `read_document` — no args. Returns the window's current Markdown + outline,
  including anything the user pasted/edited into it.
- `highlight_passage` — `{ section?, text?, clear? }`. Highlights a passage in the
  window and scrolls it into view; call repeatedly while briefing.
- `brief_from_canvas` — `{ title? }`. Lifts text the user pasted/selected on the
  canvas into the briefing window. Prefers the selection; else the largest text
  block.

### Session re-grounding (cross-session continuity)

On every session connect, if the canvas is non-empty, the client injects a compact
**textual summary of the current scene** (shape/connector/image counts, labels,
open-document title) as the first conversation item, framed as automated context
(no `response.create`, and the model must not thank the user for it). This keeps a
resumed session referentially consistent with the board it is working on. The
summary is *derived* from the live scene each time (never stored), so it cannot
drift from what the user sees. Source: `src/canvas/summarizeScene.ts`, injected via
`RealtimeClient`'s `getCanvasGrounding` callback. See
[ADR-0009](decisions/ADR-0009-session-regrounding-from-canvas.md).

### Behavioral rules

- Invalid enum values / malformed elements are dropped during normalization.
- Connectors referencing unknown ids are skipped.
- Drawing replaces the previous tool-drawn shapes; user-drawn shapes, generated
  images, website screenshots, and the document window are left untouched.
- The `capture_canvas` screenshot is injected as a `user`-role message but
  labelled as an automated capture; the agent must not thank the user for it.

## Testing Strategy

See [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md). Today: `npm run typecheck` + `npm run build` as
gates, plus manual/automated browser verification. Pure functions
(`normalizeFlow`, `normalizeCanvasElements`) are the priority targets for unit
tests.

## Boundaries

- **Always:** keep every API key server-side; validate tool args before drawing;
  run `npm run typecheck` before commit; mirror Excalidraw values from the package.
- **Ask first:** adding dependencies; changing the tool contract; changing the
  canvas-as-projection model; adding a new server-side provider/key.
- **Never:** commit `.env.local` or secrets; let the browser hold an API key;
  treat the Excalidraw scene JSON as the durable source of truth.

## Success Criteria

- Voice and text produce identical tool calls / canvas behavior.
- The agent draws varied structures (not only flowcharts) for open-ended prompts.
- A malformed tool call never crashes the canvas (validated away).
- `npm run build` and `npm run typecheck` pass clean.
- No API key ever appears in the client bundle or git history.

## Open Questions

- Persistence beyond localStorage — what (if anything) the user leaves a session
  with across devices.
- File/PDF upload + OCR as briefing sources (the paste/Markdown path is live).
- How strict the trust/review model should be on a live creative canvas.
