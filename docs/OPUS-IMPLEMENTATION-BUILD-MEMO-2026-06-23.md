# Lumen Light Opus Implementation Build Memo

## Verdict

The implementation build plan in
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-BUILD-PLAN-2026-06-23.md` is directionally correct and
well-sequenced after correction: assistant/operator-controlled briefing loop
with Excalidraw projection included from the beginning, then schema
reconciliation, adapter, deeper Excalidraw integration, then voice.

Three corrections matter:

1. Do not touch `src/static-highlighter/lumen-light.js` in the first PR. Reuse
   its anchoring strategy in a new scoped module, then unify later.
2. Sequence schema reconciliation after the first local demo. The current
   schema contradicts the demo shape, so validating too early would pull the
   team back into schema-first drift.
3. Decide the host runtime before voice. The first demo can be framework-free
   ESM; voice later needs a server for ephemeral Realtime session credentials.

The smallest first PR should make Lumen Light testable locally with no voice,
no model call, and no schema reconciliation. It should include Excalidraw as a
first-class projection lane, because the product is intended to be a shared
visual briefing surface from the start.

## Repo Reality Check

What exists and runs:

- `src/static-highlighter/lumen-light.js`: a working dependency-free
  highlighter with prefix/suffix re-anchoring, but it is a global
  `window.lumen` singleton tied to `document.body` and `localStorage`.
- `schemas/conversation-artifact.schema.json`,
  `scripts/validate_artifact.py`, and `test/test_validate_artifact.py`:
  deterministic validation of current fixtures.
- `prototypes/lumen-light-whiteboard-prototype/`: a separate Node 24
  Express/WebSocket app with Excalidraw, transcription, a text agent, and a
  substantial Node test suite.

What does not exist:

- a combined source-pane, briefing-pane, and staging UI
- a root JavaScript test harness
- packet-level export/import schema
- speech-to-speech voice or Realtime tool bindings

Current contradictions:

- `schemas/conversation-artifact.schema.json` requires `source_turn_ids`,
  which blocks document-first artifacts that only have `source_span`.
- The schema is missing `claim`, `risk`, and `insight`.
- Approval state exists only inside `surface.state`, which conflates projection
  state with artifact approval state.
- `src/static-highlighter/lumen-light.js` is not scoped enough for a
  per-session source pane.
- The Excalidraw prototype is a separate runtime, so the first product surface
  should include a minimal controlled Excalidraw projection rather than making
  the prototype runtime the durable model.

## First PR Recommendation

Build a local grounded briefing review demo: text-controlled, assistant/operator
driven, with Excalidraw present as the visual projection surface.

The demo should:

- render one synthetic source document
- render scripted agent briefing turns
- activate the referenced source span when a turn is clicked
- show proposed artifacts in a staging pane
- project proposed artifacts into Excalidraw as cards/nodes
- allow accept, reject, and edit
- update Excalidraw projection state when artifacts are accepted, rejected, or
  edited
- export accepted artifacts as JSON

The first PR export should use its own briefing-packet shape. It should not be
forced through the current artifact schema yet.

## First PR File-Level Change List

Add:

- `package.json`: root zero-dependency Node test harness with
  `node --test test/briefing-review`
- `src/briefing-review/state.js`: pure artifact state machine with
  `stage`, `accept`, `reject`, `edit`, and `exportAccepted`
- `src/briefing-review/source-pane.js`: scoped source-span anchoring and
  activation
- `src/briefing-review/excalidraw-projection.js`: deterministic mapping from
  staged/accepted artifacts to Excalidraw projection elements
- `examples/briefing-session.example.json`: synthetic source text, scripted
  briefing turns, and proposed artifacts
- `examples/briefing-review-demo.html`: browser demo with source, briefing,
  staging, Excalidraw projection, and export panes
- `test/briefing-review/state.test.js`
- `test/briefing-review/anchor.test.js`
- `test/briefing-review/excalidraw-projection.test.js`

Modify:

- `README.md`: add a "Run the briefing demo" section

Do not modify:

- `src/static-highlighter/lumen-light.js` in the first PR

## First PR Test Plan

Use root `node --test` for pure logic tests:

- staged to accepted sets state correctly
- staged to rejected sets state correctly
- edit records edited text and state
- illegal transitions are rejected
- `exportAccepted` returns accepted artifacts by default
- debug export can include rejected artifacts
- span resolver returns correct offsets for exact match
- repeated text is disambiguated with prefix/suffix
- missing span reports a skip instead of mis-highlighting
- every scripted briefing turn references an existing source span/artifact
- staged/accepted artifacts map to deterministic Excalidraw projection objects
- reject/edit actions update projection state without mutating artifact
  identity

Keep the existing Python validation tests green:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s test
```

Keep the prototype test suite green when the prototype is touched:

```bash
cd prototypes/lumen-light-whiteboard-prototype
node --test
```

## Reuse Guidance

Reuse from `src/static-highlighter/`:

- the prefix/suffix anchoring strategy
- skip-rather-than-force behavior when a span cannot be re-anchored

Do not reuse from `src/static-highlighter/` in the first PR:

- the IIFE wrapper
- `window.lumen`
- `localStorage` persistence
- document-wide singleton behavior

Reuse from the Excalidraw prototype immediately, but narrowly:

- skeleton element shape
- artifact-to-visual mapping concepts
- rendering conventions that make cards/nodes easy to inspect

Reuse from the Excalidraw prototype later:

- agent/provider and settings concepts after the text loop is stable

Keep out of the first product slice:

- the whiteboard system prompt
- prompt-cache warmup loop
- line-numbered whiteboard edit tools
- direct Excalidraw element JSON as durable state

## Agent Adapter Placement

Add the future agent adapter at:

```text
src/briefing-review/agent-adapter.js
```

Use a stable `briefing_turn` interface:

- `turn_id`
- `speaker`
- `text`
- `source_span_refs`
- `proposed_artifact_ids`

Start with a deterministic fixture-backed adapter. Add the model-backed
adapter later. Model output may only create staged artifacts; human approval is
the only path to accepted artifacts.

## OpenAI Realtime Sequencing

Realtime voice feasibility is settled by the research doc. It should follow
the local text loop.

Order:

1. Build the briefing-review loop as portable ESM.
2. Mount it under a server after the local demo works.
3. Add a trusted endpoint to mint ephemeral `gpt-realtime-2` session
   credentials.
4. Add a browser WebRTC client.
5. Bind Lumen tools:
   - `highlight_source_span`
   - `focus_artifact`
   - `create_staged_artifact`
   - `request_human_review`
6. Tool calls write staged artifacts or active highlights only.
7. Spoken turns are captured as briefing turns.

Voice is deferred until after the integrated source/briefing/review/Excalidraw
projection loop works.

## Not Now

- speech-to-speech voice and Realtime tool bindings
- model-backed agent generation
- cross-origin iframe highlighting
- multi-user collaboration
- memory return path
- generated AV
- refactoring `lumen-light.js` before the scoped source-pane module proves the
  interaction

## Risks That Could Block A Local Test

- Schema collision if the first demo export is forced through the current
  artifact schema too early.
- Browser `file://` module issues. Mitigation: document
  `python3 -m http.server` as the demo run path.
- No root JavaScript test harness today. Mitigation: first commit adds one.
- Anchoring failure for scripted spans. Mitigation: tests must assert
  skip-with-report instead of wrong-place highlighting.
